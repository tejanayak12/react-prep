## Key Questions:

**1. What is the purpose of defining comments in HTML?**

Comments in HTML are blocks of text that are not displayed by the browser. They serve several important purposes:

- **Code Explanation:** Comments provide explanations or notes about the code's functionality, making it easier for you or other developers to understand and maintain the codebase.
- **Code Organization:**  Comments can be used to visually separate different sections of your code, making it more organized and readable.
- **Debugging:**  Temporarily commenting out sections of code can be a helpful debugging technique to isolate problems.
- **Communication:** Comments can be used to communicate with other developers who might work on the same codebase.

**How to add comments in HTML:**

Comments are enclosed within `<!-- -->`.

```html
<!-- Sample Comment -->
```

**2. How do you include a video in HTML?**

You can embed a video in HTML using the `<video>` tag. This tag provides several attributes to control the video playback:

```html
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
```

- **`width` and `height`:**  Specify the dimensions of the video player.
- **`controls`:** Adds default browser controls (play/pause, volume, etc.).
- **`<source>`:** Specifies the video file and its type. Multiple `<source>` elements can be used to provide different video formats for better browser compatibility.
