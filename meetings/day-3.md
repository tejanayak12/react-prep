**2. What are semantic HTML elements and how are they used?**

Semantic HTML elements are tags that convey the meaning or purpose of the content they contain. Unlike generic elements like `<div>` and `<span>`, semantic elements provide additional information about the role of the content, making it easier for browsers, screen readers, and search engines to understand.

**Examples:**

- `<header>`: Defines the header of a page or section.
- `<nav>`: Contains navigation links.
- `<main>`:  Encloses the main content of the page.
- `<article>`: Represents a self-contained piece of content.
- `<section>`: Groups related content.
- `<aside>`: Contains content that is tangentially related to the main content.
- `<footer>`: Defines the footer of a page or section.

**Benefits:**

- Improved accessibility for users with disabilities.
- Better SEO (Search Engine Optimization) as search engines can understand the content more accurately.
- More readable and maintainable code.

**3. What is the box model in CSS and how does it work?**

The box model is a fundamental concept in CSS. It describes how every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box, with four areas:

- **Content:** The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.).
- **Padding:**  The transparent space between the content and the border.
- **Border:** The line that surrounds the content and padding.
- **Margin:** The transparent space outside the border.

Understanding the box model helps you control the size, spacing, and positioning of elements on your web page.

**4. What are the differences between Flexbox and Grid layouts in CSS?**

| Feature   | Flexbox                                                                                                                                                              | Grid                                                                                                                                                                                            |
