# What Is The Difference Between HTML And CSS?

![](./images/html-and-css.webp)

**HTML** (HyperText Markup Language) and **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) are essential languages in web development. 

HTML defines a website's content and structure, while CSS specifies its appearance and layout. 

Together, they allow web designers/developers to create well-organized, visually appealing, and functional websites.

HTML is responsible for defining the structural elements of a webpage, such as:

- Headings
- Paragraphs
- Images
- Links
- Lists
- Tables
- Forms

On the other hand, CSS enhances the visual presentation of these HTML elements by applying styles. CSS controls:

- Colors
- Fonts
- Margins
- Padding
- Borders
- Backgrounds
- Positioning

Additionally, CSS enables the creation of responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
