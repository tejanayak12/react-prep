
### Responsive Design and Media Queries

Responsive design ensures that your website looks great and functions well on all devices, from desktops to tablets to mobile phones.

- **Media Queries:** CSS rules that allow you to apply different styles based on the screen size, resolution, or other device characteristics.
- **Fluid Grids:** Using percentages or relative units (e.g., `em`, `rem`) for widths instead of fixed pixels.
- **Flexible Images:**  Using the `max-width` property to make images scale appropriately.
- **Breakpoints:** Defining specific screen widths where your layout changes (e.g., switching from a multi-column layout on desktop to a single column on mobile).

```css
/* Example Media Query */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for screens smaller than 768px wide */
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
  
  nav ul {
    display: block;
  }
}
```
